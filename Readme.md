# AppBase - Get Started With Html5/MVC3 And All The Goodies

AppBase is a starting point for ASP.NET MVC3 Projects leveraging HTML5 Boilerplate [http://html5boilerplate.com](http://html5boilerplate.com) and Open Authentication with OpenId and OAuth. 

### Changelog

#### Mar. 21, 2011: Now with Twitter and Facebook sign in support
#### Nov. 15, 2010: Updated to use MVC 3 RC and Html5 Boilerplate v.0.9.5.  Also integrates certain parts of web.config file from Boilerplate.


This contains a slimmed down version of a new ASP.NET MVC 3 RC Application using the Razor view engine.  It integrates view code from Paul Irish's Html5 Boilerplate project as well as Authentication via OpenId using DotNetOpenAuth.  All sql and account management provider code has been pulled so you can add your own user logic as necessary.
